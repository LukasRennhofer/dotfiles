# My Personal Dotfiles ðŸ’«

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository!  
Here I store and maintain all my essential configuration files across different tools and environments, making it easy to set up a consistent and efficient development workflow.

## Whatâ€™s inside?

This repo contains my configurations for:

- **Hyperland** â€” my wallpapers, gruvbox like style, custom waybar style
- **Neovim** â€” fully customized with Lua, plugins, LSP, Treesitter, and more

Each config is organized in its own folder or root dotfile with clear structure and documentation.
